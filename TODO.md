Use @view when creating the design matrices and level assignment matrices!


#TODO:
 - A. Prioritised changes
   - 1. Overload for gradient compat: to_vec(), from_vec_transform(), to_linked_vec_transform(), from_linked_vec_transform()
   - 2. Optimise RegressionPrior
        - Minimise use of DimensionalData where not needed
   - 3. Finish Turing models
        - Add likelihood to simple_regression
        - Add multiple operations to multistep_regression 
- B. Optimisation
  - 2. Ensure type stability
  - 3. Pre-allocate random effect block assignments
- C. Core Utilities
  - 1. Make constructor function for RegressionPrior
        - A. Which construct multivariate distributions from individual priors_f
        - B. Which creates default priors or extrapolates single priors to full structure
        - C. Which checks that the inputs are all properly structured and matching
        - D. Which allows for using symbols to define the levels assignments (these are then transformed into integers)
  - 2. Make custom summary functionalities (FlexiChains & MCMCChains)
  - 3. Make custom plotting functions (FlexiChains & MCMCChains)
- D. Fixes
  - 1. Add comments with canonical mathematical notation   
  - 2. Set full, concrete type requirements everywhere possible
  - 3. Ensure that DualNumbers can be used throughout
  - 4. Make getter functions for random effect hyperparameters
  - 5. Organise repository
  - 6. Make RegressionPrior modular, so that differnet components can be sample one at a time
- E. Functionality
  - 1. unit tests
  - 2. documentation
- F. Usage
  - 1. Fit the example Turing model with FlexiChains
  - 2. Make example with Horseshoe priors.
  - 3. Make example with Spike-and-slab priors.
  - 4. Make example with a latent mixture model.
  - 5. Make example with multi-step Turing model
  - 6. Make example with categorical predictors
- G. Near future features
  - 1. Make preconstructed spike-and-slab prior distribtution 
  - 2. Make preconstructed horseshoe prior distribution 
  - 3. Make preconstructed Variance Component Analysis prior distribtution (letting random effect sd priors come from a multivariate distribution which can weigh between them).
  - 3. Allow for sharing parameters across regressions (e.g., fixed effects being identical in multiple regressions)
  - 4. Make constructor for combining multivariate distributions so that they sample vectors
  - 5. Add labels for categorical predictors
  - 6. Make example with splines / polynomial terms
  - 7. Make example with completely custom functions
  - 8. Create standard spline expansion
  - 9. Create example using polynomial expansion
  - 10. Create example with cusotm expansion
  - 11. Create example with non-multiplication interactions
  - 12. Consider nice option for when data is shared or not shared across regressions
- H. Extra
  - 1. Make Turing submodel alternative to rand and logpdf (and benchmark)
- I. Long-future and difficult features
  - 1. Structured random effects across levels (e.g., gaussian process, AR1, etc.)
  - 2. Non-parametric, infinite mixture, Dirichlet process models etc (i.e., where not just the level assignments, but also the number of levels, is inside the Turing model)   - 3. Allow for estimating group memberships of random effect levels inside the Turing model
- X. Decisions to make
  - 1. What should be the value in matrices with un-generated values? 0, undef or missing?   
  - 2. What do we do with missing values in the predictors? Set them to 0, drop them, or return an error? How about NaN?
  - Should we allow having random effects for only a single level in a categorical predictor (say, only for Treatment_High, but not Treatment_Medium)
  - 3. Should fixed effects and random effect sds be stored as flat vectors or as structured vectors internally?
